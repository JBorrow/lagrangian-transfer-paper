	abstract = {The numerical convergence of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can be severely restricted by random force errors induced by particle disorder, especially in shear flows, which are ubiquitous in astrophysics. The increase in the number NH of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all NH, despite having vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the higher-order B-splines, allowing large NH and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs rise sub-linear with NH). Our analysis also shows that at low NH the quartic spline kernel with NH {\textasciitilde}= 60 obtains much better convergence then the standard cubic spline.},

	abstract = {The splashback radius Rsp, the apocentric radius of particles on their ﬁrst orbit after falling into a dark matter halo, has recently been suggested to be a physically motivated halo boundary that separates accreting from orbiting material. Using the SPARTA code presented in Paper I, we analyze the orbits of billions of particles in cosmological simulations of structure formation and measure Rsp for a large sample of halos that span a mass range from dwarf galaxy to massive cluster halos, reach redshift 8, and include WMAP, Planck, and self-similar cosmologies. We analyze the dependence of Rsp/R200m and Msp/M200m on the mass accretion rate Γ, halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. The scatter in these relations varies between 0.02 and 0.1 dex. While we conﬁrm the known trend that Rsp/R200m decreases with Γ, the relationships turn out to be more complex than previously thought, demonstrating that Rsp is an independent deﬁnition of the halo boundary that cannot trivially be reconstructed from spherical overdensity deﬁnitions. We present ﬁtting functions for Rsp/R200m and Msp/M200m as a function of accretion rate, peak height, and redshift, achieving an accuracy of 5\% or better everywhere in the parameter space explored. We discuss the physical meaning of the distribution of particle apocenters and show that the previously proposed deﬁnition of Rsp as the radius of the steepest logarithmic density slope encloses roughly three-quarters of the apocenters. Finally, we conclude that no analytical model presented thus far can fully explain our results.},

Within this general framework, we develop an algorithm that accurately extracts the location of the ﬁrst apocenter of particles after infall into a halo, or splashback.

This deﬁnition allows us to reliably measure the splashback radii of 95\% of host halos above a resolution limit of 1000 particles. We show that, on average, the splashback radius and mass are converged to better than 5\% accuracy with respect to mass resolution, snapshot spacing, and all free parameters of the method.},

	abstract = {We perform a suite of multimass cosmological zoom simulations of individual dark matter haloes and explore how to best select Lagrangian regions for resimulation without contaminating the halo of interest with low-resolution particles. Such contamination can lead to signiﬁcant errors in the gas distribution of hydrodynamical simulations, as we show. For a ﬁxed Lagrange volume, we ﬁnd that the chance of contamination increases systematically with the level of zoom. In order to avoid contamination, the Lagrangian volume selected for resimulation must increase monotonically with the resolution difference between parent box and the zoom region. We provide a simple formula for selecting Lagrangian regions (in units of the halo virial volume) as a function of the level of zoom required. We also explore the degree to which a halo’s Lagrangian volume correlates with other halo properties (concentration, spin, formation time, shape, etc.) and ﬁnd no signiﬁcant correlation. There is a mild correlation between Lagrange volume and environment, such that haloes living in the most clustered regions have larger Lagrangian volumes. Nevertheless, selecting haloes to be isolated is not the best way to ensure inexpensive zoom simulations. We explain how one can safely choose haloes with the smallest Lagrangian volumes, which are the least expensive to resimulate, without biasing one’s sample.},

We present a detailed comparison to spatially and spectrally resolved H α and other observations of z ≈ 2 galaxies. We ﬁnd that simulations without winds produce massive, compact galaxies with low gas fractions, super-solar metallicities, high bulge fractions, and much of the star formation concentrated within the inner kiloparsec. Strong winds are required to maintain high gas fractions, redistribute star-forming gas over larger scales, and increase the velocity dispersion of simulated galaxies, more in agreement with the large, extended, turbulent disks typical of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Winds also suppress early star formation to produce high-redshift cosmic star formation efﬁciencies in better agreement with observations. Sizes, rotation velocities, and velocity dispersions all scale with stellar mass in accord with observations. Our simulations produce a diversity of morphological characteristics—among our three most massive galaxies, we ﬁnd a quiescent grand-design spiral, a very compact star-forming galaxy, and a clumpy disk undergoing a minor merger; the clumps are evident in Hα but not in the stars. Rotation curves are generally slowly rising, particularly when calculated using azimuthal velocities rather than enclosed mass. Our results are broadly resolution-converged. These results show that cosmological simulations including outﬂows can produce disk galaxies similar to those observed during the peak epoch of cosmic galaxy growth.},

On scales k 4 h Mpc−1 the effect of baryons on the amplitude of the total matter power spectrum is greater than 1 per cent. The back-reaction of baryons affects the density ﬁeld of the dark matter at the level of ∼3 per cent on scales of 1 ≤ k/( h Mpc−1) ≤ 5. The dark matter velocity divergence power spectrum at k 0.5 h Mpc−1 is changed by less than 1 per cent. The 2D redshift space power spectrum is affected at the level of ∼6 per cent at {\textbar}k{\textbar} 1 h Mpc−1 (for μ {\textgreater} 0.5), but for {\textbar}k{\textbar} ≤ 0.4 h Mpc−1 it differs by less than 1 per cent. We report vanishingly small baryonic velocity bias for haloes: the peculiar velocities of haloes with M200 {\textgreater} 3 × 1011 M (hosting galaxies with M∗ {\textgreater} 109 M ) are affected at the level of at most 1 km s−1, which is negligible for 1 per cent-precision cosmology. We caution that since EAGLE overestimates cluster gas fractions it may also underestimate the impact of baryons, particularly for the total matter power spectrum. Nevertheless, our ﬁndings suggest that for theoretical modelling of redshift space distortions and galaxy velocity-based statistics, baryons and their back-reaction can be safely ignored at the current level of observational accuracy. However, we conﬁrm that the modelling of the total matter power spectrum in weak lensing studies needs to include realistic galaxy formation physics in order to achieve the accuracy required in the precision cosmology era.},

In particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median density proﬁles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply than predicted. The steepest slope of the proﬁles occurs at r ≈ R200m, and its absolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate, reaching slopes of −4 and steeper. Importantly, we ﬁnd that the outermost density proﬁles at r R200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are rescaled by R200m. This self-similarity indicates that radii deﬁned with respect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure and evolution of the outer proﬁles. However, the inner density proﬁles are most self-similar when radii are rescaled by R200c. We propose a new ﬁtting formula that describes the median and mean proﬁles of halo samples selected by their peak height or mass accretion rate with accuracy 10\% at all radii, redshifts, and masses we studied, r 9Rvir, 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 6, and Mvir {\textgreater} 1.7 × 1010 h−1 M .

We explore the impact of these new recipes on the evolution of fundamental galaxy properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas and stellar phase metallicity. We present predictions for stellar mass functions, stellar mass versus SFR relations, and cold gas phase and stellar mass–metallicity relations for our ﬁducial models, from redshift z ∼ 6 to the present day. In addition we present predictions for the global SFR, mass assembly history, and cosmic enrichment history. We ﬁnd that the predicted stellar properties of galaxies (stellar mass, SFR, metallicity) are remarkably insensitive to the details of the recipes used for partitioning gas into H I and H2. We see signiﬁcant sensitivity to the recipes for H2 formation only in very low mass haloes (Mh 1010.5 M ), which host galaxies with stellar masses m∗ 108 M . The properties of low-mass galaxies are also quite insensitive to the details of the recipe used for converting H2 into stars, while the formation epoch of massive galaxies does depend on this signiﬁcantly. We argue that this behaviour can be interpreted within the framework of a simple equilibrium model for galaxy evolution, in which the conversion of cold gas into stars is balanced on average by inﬂows and outﬂows.},

	abstract = {We analyze the metal accumulation in dwarf and spiral galaxies by following the history of metal enrichment and outﬂows in a suite of 20 high-resolution simulated galaxies. These simulations agree with the observed stellar and gas-phase mass–metallicity relation, an agreement that relies on large fractions of the produced metals escaping into the circumgalactic media. For instance, in galaxies with Mvir∼109.5–1010 M, we ﬁnd that about ∼85\% of the available metals are outside of the galactic disk at z=0, although the fraction decreases to a little less than half in Milky-Way-mass galaxies. In many cases, these metals are spread far beyond the virial radius. We analyze the metal deﬁcit within the ISM and stars in the context of previous work tracking the inﬂow and outﬂow of baryons. Outﬂows are prevalent across the entire mass range, as is reaccretion. We ﬁnd that between 40\% and 80\% of all metals removed from the galactic disk are later reaccreted. The outﬂows themselves are metal-enriched relative to the ISM by a factor of 0.2 dex because of the correspondence between sites of metal enrichment and outﬂows. As a result, the metal mass loading factor scales as hmetals µ vc-ir0c.91, a somewhat shallower scaling than the total mass loading factor. We analyze the simulated galaxies within the context of analytic chemical evolution models by determining their net metal expulsion efﬁciencies, which encapsulate the rates of metal loss and reaccretion. We discuss these results in light of the inﬂow and outﬂow properties necessary for reproducing the mass–metallicity relation.},

We quantify the importance of ejective feedback to setting the stellar mass relative to the efﬁciency of gas accretion and star formation. Ejective feedback is increasingly important as galaxy mass decreases; we ﬁnd an effective mass loading factor that scales as vc-ir2c.2, with an amplitude and shape that are invariant with redshift. These scalings are consistent with analytic models for energy-driven wind, based solely on the halo potential. Recycling is common: about half of the outﬂow mass across all galaxy masses is later reaccreted. The recycling timescale is typically ∼1 Gyr, virtually independent of halo mass. Recycled material is reaccreted farther out in the disk and with typically ∼2–3 times more angular momentum. These results elucidate and quantify how the baryon cycle plausibly regulates star formation and alters the angular momentum distribution of disk material across the halo mass range where most cosmic star formation occurs.},

At these low redshifts, LLSs are closely associated with dense gas structures surrounding galaxies, such as galactic winds, dwarf satellites and cool inﬂows from the intergalactic medium. Our analysis is based on 14 zoom-in simulations covering the halo mass range Mh ≈ 109–1013 M at z = 0, which we convolve with the dark matter halo mass function to produce cosmological statistics. We ﬁnd that the majority of cosmologically selected LLSs are associated with haloes in the mass range 1010 Mh 1012 M . The incidence and H I column density distribution of simulated absorbers with columns in the range 1016.2 ≤ NH I ≤ 2 × 1020 cm−2 are consistent with observations. High-velocity outﬂows (with radial velocity exceeding the halo circular velocity by a factor of 2) tend to have higher metallicities ([X/H] ∼ −0.5) while very low metallicity ([X/H] {\textless} −2) LLSs are typically associated with gas infalling from the intergalactic medium. However, most LLSs occupy an intermediate region in metallicity-radial velocity space, for which there is no clear trend between metallicity and radial kinematics. The overall simulated LLS metallicity distribution has a mean (standard deviation) [X/H] = −0.9 (0.4) and does not show signiﬁcant evidence for bimodality, in contrast to recent observational studies, but consistent with LLSs arising from haloes with a broad range of masses and metallicities.},

By varying both physical and numerical parameters, we investigate under what conditions the subhaloes undergo disruption. We conﬁrm the conclusions from our more analytical assessment in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved with sufﬁcient mass and force resolution, a bound remnant survives. This implies that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from signiﬁcant overmerging. We demonstrate that this is mainly due to inadequate force softening, which causes excessive mass loss and artiﬁcial tidal disruption. In addition, we show that subhaloes in N-body simulations are susceptible to a runaway instability triggered by the ampliﬁcation of discreteness noise in the presence of a tidal ﬁeld. These two processes conspire to put serious limitations on the reliability of dark matter substructure in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We present two criteria that can be used to assess whether individual subhaloes in cosmological simulations are reliable or not, and advocate that subhaloes that satisfy either of these two criteria be discarded from further analysis. We discuss the potential implications of this work for several areas in astrophysics.},

Although a radio counterpart is detected at 1.4 GHz, it is faint enough that the quasar is considered to be radio quiet by all standard criteria, and there is no evidence of extended emission due to radio lobes, whether aged or continuously powered by an ongoing jet. We argue that the likely level of star formation is insufﬁcient to power the observed energetic outﬂow and that SDSS J1356 + 1026 is a good case for radio-quiet quasar feedback. In further support of this hypothesis, polarimetric observations show that the direction of quasar illumination is coincident with the direction of the outﬂow.},

	abstract = {Black hole feedback is now a standard component of galaxy formation models. These models predict that the impact of black hole activity on its host galaxy likely peaked at z = 2–3, the epoch of strongest star formation activity and black hole accretion activity in the Universe. We used XSHOOTER on the Very Large Telescope to measure rest-frame optical spectra of four z ∼ 2.5 extremely red quasars with infrared luminosities ∼1047 erg s−1. We present the discovery of very broad (full width at half max = 2600–5000 km s−1), strongly blueshifted (by up to 1500 km s−1) [O III] λ5007 Å emission lines in these objects. In a large sample of type 2 and red quasars, [O III] kinematics are positively correlated with infrared luminosity, and the four objects in our sample are on the extreme end in both [O III] kinematics and infrared luminosity. We estimate that at least 3 per cent of the bolometric luminosity in these objects is being converted into the kinetic power of the observed wind. Photo-ionization estimates suggest that the [O III] emission might be extended on a few kpc scales, which would suggest that the extreme outﬂow is affecting the entire host galaxy of the quasar. These sources may be the signposts of the most extreme form of quasar feedback at the peak epoch of galaxy formation, and may represent an active ‘blow-out’ phase of quasar evolution.},

	abstract = {Radiation, winds, and jets from the active nucleus of a massive galaxy can interact with its interstellar medium, and this can lead to ejection or heating of the gas. This terminates star formation in the galaxy and stiﬂes accretion onto the black hole. Such active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between the central black hole and the host galaxy mass. Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback, which occurs when AGN are very luminous, has been difﬁcult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radioemitting jets often seen when AGN are operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium. The energy ﬂow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by an order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived heating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a further mode of energy feedback that affects the cores of groups and subclusters. New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will come into operation over the next several years and lead to a rapid expansion in observational data on all modes of AGN feedback.},

	abstract = {We investigate how the way galaxies acquire their gas across cosmic time in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations is modiﬁed by a comprehensive physical model for baryonic feedback processes. To do so, we compare two simulations – with and without feedback – both evolved with the moving mesh code AREPO. The feedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation project, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback from supermassive black holes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material contributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the intergalactic medium, ﬁnding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as well as the net, inﬂow of this ‘smooth mode’ gas at all redshifts, regardless of the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the temperature and radial ﬂux of inﬂowing gas is largely unaffected at z = 2. However, the spherical covering fraction of inﬂowing gas at 0.25 rvir decreases substantially, from more than 80 per cent to less than 50 per cent, while the rates of both inﬂow and outﬂow increase, indicative of recycling across this boundary. (c) The fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the total accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of 2 across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold temperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z {\textless} 1. (d) The amount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy – the ‘halo transit time’ – increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of 2–3, and is notably independent of halo mass. We discuss the possible implications of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.},

  abstract = {The standard galaxy formation theory assumes that baryons and dark matter are initially well mixed before becoming segregated due to radiative cooling. We use non-radiative hydrodynamical simulations to explicitly examine this assumption and find that baryons and dark matter can also be segregated due to different characteristics of gas and dark matter during the buildup of the halo. As a result, baryons in many haloes do not originate from the same Lagrangian region as the dark matter. When using the fraction of corresponding dark matter and gas particles in the initial conditions (the `paired fraction') as a proxy of the dark matter and gas segregation strength of a halo, on average about 25 per cent of the baryonic and dark matter of the final halo are segregated in the initial conditions. This is at odds with the assumption of the standard galaxy formation model. A consequence of this effect is that the baryons and dark matter of the same halo initially experience different tidal torques and thus their angular momentum vectors are often misaligned. The degree of the misalignment is largely preserved during later halo assembly and can be understood with the tidal torque theory. The result challenges the precision of some semi-analytical approaches that utilize dark matter halo merger trees to infer properties of gas associated with dark matter haloes.},
