\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Cosmological simulations are an important tool to study the evolution of the
universe. Mass elements of various matter components are tracked over cosmic
time under the influence of gravity and other forces until a desired
redshift, where the distribution of matter can be compared to observations.
The earliest simulations included only dark matter acting under gravity
\citep[see e.g.][]{Frenk1988, Springel2005a}, which remains an important
approach to this day because such simulations are computationally efficient
and can model very large volumes required for, e.g., dark energy studies
\citep{Knabenhans2019}. However, such simulations do not directly model the
observable component. As such, techniques such as semi-analytic models (SAMs)
have been developed \citep{FrenkWhite1990,Kauffmann1996,Somerville1998} to
populate dark matter halos with galaxies \citep[see e.g.][for modern examples
of SAM frameworks]{Porter2014, Henriques2015, Somerville2015b, Lacey2016}.
Crucially, it has been recognized that feedback processes from the formation
of stars and black holes have an important effect on the resulting observable
baryonic component, though they have a small effect on the collisionless dark
matter. Such feedback often takes the form of large-scale winds that eject
substantial amounts of gas from galaxies owing to energetic input from young
stars, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei (AGN). This gas can then be
deposited far out in the intergalactic medium (IGM), remain as halo gas in
the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM), or be re-accreted in `wind recycling'
\citep{Oppenheimer2010, Christensen2016, AnglesAlcazar2017, Hafen2017,
Christensen2018}. This cycling of baryons is an integral part of modern
galaxy formation theory, and is believed to be a key factor in establishing
the observed properties of both galaxies and intergalactic gas
\citep{Somerville2015}.

With advancing computational speed and algorithmic developments, it has
become possible to run full hydrodynamical models of the universe that
explicitly track the baryonic component \citep[e.g.][]{Hernquist1989,
Teyssier2002, Springel2005b}. Beyond modelling hydrodynamical processes,
sub-grid prescriptions have been implemented in order to cool the gas and
produce stars, with increasing levels of refinement and sophistication
\citep[e.g.][]{Revaz2012, Vogelsberger2014, Schaye2015, Hopkins2018}. Using
these models it is now possible to reproduce many of the key observed
properties of galaxies at a range of cosmic epochs. Modern galaxy formation
simulations typically include radiative cooling, chemical enrichment, star
formation, stellar feedback, and AGN feedback. Despite playing a critical
role in regulating galaxy growth \citep{Naab2017}, feedback remains poorly
understood. These models must prevent too much star formation, as well as the
`overcooling problem', suffered by the earliest hydrodynamical simulations
\citep{Dave2001,Balogh2001}.

Feedback processes also transport baryons far from their originating dark
matter halos. Early observational evidence for this was that the diffuse
intergalactic medium at high redshift is enriched with metals produced by
supernovae, requiring winds with speeds of hundreds of $\kms{}$ to be ejected
ubiquitously \citep[e.g.][]{Aguirre2001, Springel2003, Oppenheimer2006}. More
recently, feedback from AGN is seen to eject ionised and molecular gas
outflows with velocities exceeding 1000 $\kms{}$
\citep[e.g.][]{Sturm2001, Greene2012, Maiolino2012, Zakamska2016}. It has
long been known that some AGN also power jets, carrying material out at
relativistic velocities \citep{Fabian2012}. These processes decouple the
baryonic matter from the dark matter on cosmological scales, which could
potentially complicate approaches to populating dark matter simulations with
baryons. Hence it is important to quantify the amount of baryons that are
participating in such large-scale motions, within the context of modern
galaxy formation models that broadly reproduce the observed galaxy
population.

This paper thus examines the large-scale redistribution of baryons relative to the
dark matter, using the \simba{} cosmological simulations that include kinetic
feedback processes which plausibly reproduces the observed galaxy population
\citep{Dave2019}. To do this, we pioneer a suite of tools to compare the
initial and final location of baryons relative to their initial `Lagrangian
region', defined as the region in the initial conditions that collapses into
a given dark matter halo. In classical galaxy formation theory, the baryons
follow the dark matter into the halo, and only then significantly decouple
owing to radiative processes; this would result in the baryons lying mostly
within the Lagrangian region of the halo. However, outflows can disrupt this
process, and result in the transfer of baryons outside the Lagrangian region
or even transfer \emph{between} Lagrangian regions. It is these effects we
seek to quantify in this work.

The importance of ejecting baryons and the resulting transfer of material to
other galaxies was highlighted using recent cosmological `zoom-in'
simulations from the FIRE project \citep{Hopkins2014,Hopkins2018}. Tracking
individual gas resolution elements in the simulations,
\citet{AnglesAlcazar2017} showed that gas ejected in winds from one galaxy
(often a satellite) can accrete onto another galaxy (often the central) and
fuel in-situ star formation. This mechanism, dubbed `intergalactic transfer',
was found to be a significant contributor to galaxy growth. The galaxies that
provided intergalactic transfer material often ended up merging with the
central galaxy by $z=0$, with their mass contribution via winds greatly
exceeding that of the merger events. However, this work did not examine the
extent to which galactic winds can push gas to larger scales and connect
individual halos at $z=0$, since it is not feasible to examine this in
zoom-in simulations that by construction focus on modelling a single halo.

In this work, we consider matter flows in a large cosmological volume ($50
\hmpc{}$) using the \simba{} simulations \citep{Dave2019}, whose star
formation feedback employs scalings from FIRE, and whose black hole model
includes various forms of AGN feedback including high-velocity jets. More
generally, we present a framework for analysing the relative motion of dark
matter and baryons on large scales owing to hydrodynamic and feedback
processes. With this, we quantify the large scale gas flows out of Lagrangian
regions into the surrounding IGM and the importance of `inter-Lagrangian
transfer' in galaxy evolution.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in \S\ref{sec:simba}, we
discuss the \simba{} simulation suite that is used for analysis; in
\S\ref{sec:feedbackmetrics}, we discuss a distance-based metric for the
investigation of feedback strength; in \S\ref{sec:transfer}, we discuss
halo-level metrics based on Lagrangian regions to study inter-Lagrangian
transfer; in \S\ref{sec:convergence} we discuss the convergence of the
method; and in \S\ref{sec:conclusions} we conclude and summarise the results.
