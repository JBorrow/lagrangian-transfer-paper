\section{Introduction}

\blue{We'll wait until the end to write this up properly, of course.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item General introduction to cosmological simulations, like I gave in talk
    \item Transfer is now possible, in both ways: cooling is strong attractor, hydro \& feedback other way
    \item Quantified by Daniel in paper before
    \item Can we look at this statistically at z=0
    \item Need to look at lagrangian regions
    \item Some stuff about how people do zoom-ins (very conservative scheme)
\end{enumerate}}
