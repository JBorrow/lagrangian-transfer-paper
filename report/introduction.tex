\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item General introduction to cosmological simulations, like I gave in talk
    \item Transfer is now possible, in both ways: cooling is strong attractor, hydro & feedback other way
    \item Quantified by Daniel in paper before
    \item Can we look at this statistically at z=0
    \item Need to look at lagrangian regions
    \item Some stuff about how people do zoom-ins
    \item Very conservative
\end{itemize}
