\subsection{Code}

The code used in this analysis, {\tt LTCaesar} is made available to the community for use with their own simulations\footnote{https://www.github.com/jborrow/lagrangian-transfer}. This code can also be installed with the `pip` python packaging manager.

{\tt LTCaesar} uses the numerical routines from {\tt numpy}, the KDTree from {\tt scipy} for nearest neighbour searching, and the halo finder wrapper from {\tt caesar} \citep{numpy, scipy, caesar}. Full documentation, and more information, can be found on the code webpages.
