\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Code}

The code used in this analysis, {\tt LTCaesar} is made available to the community for use with their own simulations\footnote{https://www.github.com/jborrow/lagrangian-transfer}. This code can also be installed with the `pip` python packaging manager.

{\tt LTCaesar} uses the numerical routines from {\tt numpy}, the KDTree from {\tt scipy} for nearest neighbour searching, and the halo finder wrapper from {\tt caesar} \citep{numpy, scipy, caesar}. Full documentation, and more information, can be found on the code webpages.

\subsection{Comparison between AHF and a traditional 3D Friends-of-Friends algorithm}

Qualitatively, the results from both of these are the same; however we see significant variation at the high-mass end. This is likely due to significant differences in the way that the structure of these halos is shown.
