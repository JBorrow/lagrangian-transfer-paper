\subsection{Code}

The code used in this analysis, {\tt LTCaesar} is made available to the
community for use with their own
simulations\footnote{https://www.github.com/jborrow/lagrangian-transfer}. This
code can also be installed with the `pip` python packaging manager.

{\tt LTCaesar} uses the numerical routines from {\tt numpy}, the KDTree from
{\tt scipy} for nearest neighbour searching, and the halo finder wrapper from
{\tt caesar} \citep{NumPy2018, Jones2001, Thompson2018}. Full documentation,
and more information, can be found on the code webpages. The work in this paper
in particular made use of the Intel Distribution for Python that provides
optimized routines for {\tt numpy} and {\tt scipy} \citep{Pavlyk2017}.

The visualisations in this work made use of {\tt py-sphviewer}
\citep{Benitez-Llambay2015}.
