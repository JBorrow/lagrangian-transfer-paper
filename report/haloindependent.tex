\section{Halo-indepdent Measures of Transfer}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe distance measure
    \item Caveats based on particle ID issues
    \item Bring in the plots
    \item Analysis: the CGM is a thing
    \item Combining with halo definition
    \item Careful analysis: most of the gas in the CGM comes from other LRs
\end{enumerate}
