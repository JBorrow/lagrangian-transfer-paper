\section{Combining metrics}

The above two metrics give us a hanlde on what happens to the gas with respect to the dark matter in a given cosmological simulation. They tell us subtley different things, though. The mass fractions tell us more about the specific spatial distribution of the resulting gas and stars, wheras counterintuitively the distance metric tells us about how the dynamics of the system affect what happens to a given particle.
