\section{Combining metrics}
\label{sec:combining}

\blue{In this section I would like to combine the two metrics and look at where
the large-distance stuff comes from. We know that the majority of it ends up
outside halos.}

\blue{I also think it's worth interrogating more the super large distances that
stuff gets out to with the gas and dark matter. Where does that stuff live?}

\blue{Would be nice to have some visualisations here showing where the stuff
comes from/ends up.}

\blue{I am guessing a lot of that gas will end up in the CGM. It would be nice
to have a plot of chance of being from transfer v.s. position in halo.}
