\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Brief summary of numerical results
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 40\% of baryonic mass of a given halo originates outside LR
		\item Follow up from Angles-Alcazar 2017
	\end{itemize}
	\item Interpretation:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Preventative feedback (wtf is this)
		\item SAM is dead?
		\item Consequences for zooms
		\item Consequences for the formation of the CGM
	\end{itemize}
	\item Can use very complex methods such as tracking particles across all
	      snapshots but this is unecessary.
\end{itemize}
