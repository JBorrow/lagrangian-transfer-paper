In this work a new framework for analysing the movement of baryonic matter
in cosmological simulations is presented. This analysis uses two snapshots;
the initial conditions, and final state of the simulation, to look at how
matter has been transferred between bound structures. This is performed using
two independent metrics; the distance between two closest neighbours in the
initial conditions in the final simulation state, and the fractions of mass
in halos at redshift $z=0$ that originated in a given lagrangian region as
defined by the dark matter. Only 60\% of the baryonic matter in a given halo
at $z=0$, roughly independent of halo mass, originates from the lagrangian
region defined by the resident dark matter in that halo. This presents
interesting problems for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, as well
as zoom-in simulations, as at least 10\% of the baryonic mass in a halo
originated in the region defined by the dark matter of another halo. We present
a number of significant avenues for future research.
