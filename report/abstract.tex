In this work a new framework for analysing the movement of baryonic matter in
cosmological simulations is presented, requiring only the initial conditions
and final state of the simulation. This is performed using two independent
metrics; the distance between two closest neighbours in the initial conditions
in the final simulation state, and the fractions of mass in halos at redshift
$z=0$ that originated in a given lagrangian region as defined by the dark
matter. The framework is then applied to the $50\hmpc{}$, $512^3$ particle
\simba{} box, showing that only 60\% of the baryonic matter in a given halo at
$z=0$, roughly independent of halo mass, originates from the lagrangian region
defined by the resident dark matter in that halo. This presents possible
issues for semi- analytic models of galaxy formation, as well as zoom-in
simulations, as 5-10\% of the baryonic mass in a typical Milky Way mass halo
originated in the region defined by the dark matter of another halo.
