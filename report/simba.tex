\section{The \simba Simulation Suite}


This work uses the \simba simulation suite \citep{}, which inherits a large
amount of physics from \mufasa \citep{dave2016}. \simba uses a variant of the
GIZMO code \citep{hopkins2015}, with the Meshless-Finite-Mass (MFM)
hydrodynamics solver. This solver uses a \blue{Wentland C2} kernel with 64
neighbours. In the 50 Mpc, $512^3$, box, the mass resolution for the
hydrodynamically active particles is \blue{$<>$ M$_\odot$}. The gravitational
forces are solved using the \blue{Tree-PM method as described in
\citet{springel2005}}, of which GIZMO is a descendent. There are $512^3$ dark
matter particles in the box, with a dark matter mass resolution of \blue{$<>$
M$_\odot$}. The cosmology used in \simba comes from \citet{planck2016}, with
$\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.3$, $\Omega_{\rm b} = 0.048$, $H_0
= 68$ km s$^{-1}$, $\sigma_8=0.82$, and $n_s=0.97$.

On top of this base code, the \simba sub-grid model is implemented. This model
is fully described in \citet{}, but it is summarised here. Radiative cooling
and photoionisation are included from Grackle-3.1 \citep{}. Stellar feedback is
modeled using decoupled two-phase winds that have 30\% of their ejected
particles set at a temperature given by the supernova energy minus the kinetic
energy of the wind. In \simba, the mass loading factor of these winds scales
with stellar mass using scalins from \citet{muratov2015} that were calibrated
using the FIRE zoom-in simulations \citep{}.

Black holes are now fully modelled in \simba, using the torque-limited
accretion model from \citet{anglesalcazar2017} and \citet{bondi29832} accretion
for the hot gas. The model for the black holes includes both kinetic (winds)
and energetic (X-ray) feedback. At high \citet{eddington} ratios, the
radiative-mode winds are ejected at ISM temperature at low velocity $\sim 10^3$
km s$^{-1}$. At low Eddington ratios, the jet-mode winds are ejected at a much
higher ($\sim 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$) velocity; however these high-velocity winds
are only allowed for black hole masses $M_{\rm BH} > 10^8$ M$_\odot$. We refer
the interested reader to the full description of this feedback model in
\citet{dave2018}.

The \simba simulation suite was calibrated to \blue{Need to know how it was
calibrated}.
