\section{The \simba{} Simulation Suite}
\label{sec:simba}

This work uses the \simba{} simulation suite \citep{Dave2018}, which inherits a
large amount of physics from \mufasa{} \citep{Dave2016}. \simba{} uses a
variant of the GIZMO code \citep{Hopkins2015}, with the Meshless-Finite-Mass
(MFM) hydrodynamics solver. This solver uses a Wentland C2 kernel with 64
neighbours. In the $50 \hmpc{}$, $512^3$, box used here, the mass resolution for the
hydrodynamically active particles is $1\times10^7h^{-1}$ M$_\odot$. The
gravitational forces are solved using the Tree-PM method as described in
\citet{Springel2005b} for Gadget-2, of which GIZMO is a descendent. There are
$512^3$ dark matter particles in the box, with a dark matter mass resolution of
$7\times10^7h^{-1}$ M$_\odot$. The cosmology used in \simba{} comes from
\citet{PlanckCollaboration2016}, with $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$, $\Omega_{\rm m} =
0.3$, $\Omega_{\rm b} = 0.048$, $H_0 = 68$ km s$^{-1}$, $\sigma_8=0.82$, and
$n_s=0.97$.

On top of this base code, the \simba{} sub-grid model is implemented. This
model is fully described in \citet{Dave2018}, but it is summarised here.
Radiative cooling and photoionisation are included from Grackle-3.1
\citep{Smith2016}. Stellar feedback is modelled using decoupled two-phase winds
that have 30\% of their ejected particles set at a temperature given by the
supernova energy minus the kinetic energy of the wind. In \simba{}, the mass
loading factor of these winds scales with stellar mass using scalings from
\citet{Muratov2015} that were calibrated using the FIRE zoom-in simulations
\citep{Hopkins2014}.

Black holes are now fully modelled in \simba{}, using the torque-limited
accretion model from \citet{AnglesAlcazar2017b} and \citet{Bondi1952} accretion
for the hot gas. The model for the black holes includes both kinetic (winds)
and energetic (X-ray) feedback. At high Eddington ratios, the radiative-mode
winds are ejected at ISM temperature at low velocity $\sim 10^3 \kms{}$.
At low Eddington ratios, the jet-mode winds are ejected at a much higher ($\sim
10^4\kms{}$) velocity; these high-velocity winds are however only allowed
for black hole masses $M_{\rm BH} > 10^8$ M$_\odot$. We refer the interested
reader to the full description of this feedback model in \citet{Dave2018}.
